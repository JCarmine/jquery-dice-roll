# jquery-dice-roll
This repo demonstrates the creation of a dice roll program using vanilla js and jQuery.

The requirements are as follows:
  1. Press a button and generate a number between 1 and 6. Display the
     number next to the button.
  2. The face of the die is to be drawn with divs, and should look like a standard 6-sided die.
  3. Style with CSS.
